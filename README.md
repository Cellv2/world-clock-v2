# World Clock v2

## So what is this

This is meant to be a quick reminder that I am improving, with the original project being here: [Cellv2/world-clock](https://github.com/Cellv2/world-clock).

Basically, the aim is to take the original styling and completely rewire the back end to be more.. err.. structured ðŸ˜Š

## Other goals

1) Tests (for once)

## Other

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
